# Migration Plan: BookingRes App to Expo Router with TypeScript

## Project Analysis

The current project is a React Native application built with Expo SDK 49, using JavaScript. It employs React Navigation for routing with a combination of stack and tab navigators. The application appears to be a restaurant booking platform with features for users and administrators.

### Current Structure:
- **Navigation**: Using React Navigation with Stack Navigator as the root and nested Bottom Tab Navigators
- **State Management**: Using React Context (UserContext)
- **UI Components**: Mix of custom components and libraries like react-native-paper
- **Styling**: Using NativeWind (TailwindCSS for React Native)

## Migration Goals

1. Upgrade to the latest Expo SDK
2. Convert the codebase to TypeScript
3. Migrate from React Navigation to Expo Router (file-based routing)
4. Preserve all existing functionality
5. Ensure incremental migration with working intermediate states

## Migration Plan

The migration will be organized into 4 sprints, each with specific tasks:

### Sprint 1: Environment Setup and Initial TypeScript Migration

1. **Setup TypeScript Environment**
   - Add TypeScript and required type definitions
   - Create tsconfig.json
   - Setup path aliases

2. **Create Initial Expo Router Structure**
   - Create app directory structure
   - Create root layout file
   - Create initial index route

3. **Establish Migration Patterns**
   - Create type definitions for common data structures
   - Create utility to bridge React Navigation and Expo Router during migration

4. **Migrate Context to TypeScript**
   - Convert UserContext to TypeScript
   - Add proper type definitions

5. **Documentation**
   - Create migration guide for developers
   - Document TypeScript patterns and conventions

### Sprint 2: Core Screens and Components Migration

6. **Migrate Common Components to TypeScript**
   - Convert shared UI components
   - Add type definitions

7. **Migrate Home and Authentication Screens**
   - Convert Onboarding, Login, Register screens to TypeScript
   - Implement as Expo Router routes

8. **Implement Main Tab Navigation with Expo Router**
   - Create (tabs) route group
   - Implement Home, Search, Map, and Account tabs

9. **Setup Theme and Style System in TypeScript**
   - Convert theme definitions to TypeScript
   - Create typed style helpers

10. **Testing and Bug Fixing**
    - Test core navigation flows
    - Fix any TypeScript or routing issues

### Sprint 3: Feature Screens and Advanced Routing

11. **Migrate Restaurant Detail Screens**
   - Convert Restaurant, Food Detail, and Menu screens to TypeScript
   - Implement as nested dynamic routes

12. **Migrate Booking and Order Screens**
   - Convert Booking, Order, and Success screens to TypeScript
   - Implement as nested routes with dynamic parameters

13. **Implement Modal Routes**
   - Convert screens that should appear as modals
   - Implement using Expo Router modal pattern

14. **Setup Authentication Flow with Expo Router**
   - Implement protected routes
   - Setup redirect patterns for authentication

15. **Admin Routes and Features**
   - Migrate admin screens and features
   - Implement admin route group with protection

### Sprint 4: Finalization and Optimization

16. **Complete Remaining Screen Migrations**
   - Convert any remaining JavaScript screens to TypeScript
   - Implement as Expo Router routes

17. **Deep Linking and URL Configuration**
   - Configure deep linking scheme
   - Test all route patterns and deep links

18. **Error Handling and Fallbacks**
   - Implement global error boundary
   - Create 404 and error routes

19. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review and optimize bundle size
   - Implement code splitting where appropriate

20. **Documentation and Deployment**
   - Complete documentation for the new architecture
   - Update build and deployment scripts
   - Prepare for production release

## Implementation Notes

- **Incremental Migration**: The application will remain functional throughout the migration process by maintaining compatibility between React Navigation and Expo Router during transition.
- **TypeScript Adoption**: TypeScript will be implemented gradually, starting with type definitions and then converting files one by one.
- **Testing Strategy**: Each sprint will include testing of migrated components to ensure they work as expected.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Where needed, we'll implement fallback mechanisms to ensure backward compatibility.
