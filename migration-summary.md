# Migration Summary: React Navigation to Expo Router with TypeScript

This document provides a high-level overview of the migration plan from the current JavaScript-based React Navigation app to a TypeScript-based Expo Router application.

## Migration Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking, reducing runtime errors.
2. **File-Based Routing**: Expo Router's file-based approach simplifies navigation and enables universal deep linking.
3. **Improved Developer Experience**: Better autocomplete, documentation, and refactoring support.
4. **Increased Maintainability**: Type definitions serve as documentation and ensure consistent data structures.
5. **Modern Architecture**: Aligns with the latest Expo ecosystem recommendations.

## Migration Timeline

The migration is organized into 4 sprints, each building on the previous one:

### Sprint 1: Environment Setup (Week 1-2)
- Setup TypeScript environment
- Create initial Expo Router structure
- Establish migration patterns
- Migrate context to TypeScript
- Create documentation for the migration process

### Sprint 2: Core Components and Screens (Week 3-4)
- Migrate common UI components to TypeScript
- Implement authentication and home screens
- Setup tab navigation with Expo Router
- Create type-safe theme system
- Test core navigation flows

### Sprint 3: Feature Screens and Advanced Routing (Week 5-6)
- Implement restaurant detail and food detail screens
- Migrate booking and order screens
- Create modal screens
- Setup authentication flow with protected routes
- Implement admin features

### Sprint 4: Finalization and Optimization (Week 7-8)
- Complete remaining screen migrations
- Configure deep linking
- Implement error handling and fallbacks
- Optimize performance
- Create final documentation and prepare for deployment

## Migration Strategy

The migration follows an incremental approach, ensuring the app remains functional throughout the process:

1. **Parallel Implementation**: New code is developed alongside existing code.
2. **Feature-by-Feature Migration**: Components and screens are migrated one at a time.
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Bridge utilities ensure compatibility between old and new navigation systems.
4. **Rigorous Testing**: Each migrated component is tested before proceeding to the next.

## File Structure Before and After

### Before (React Navigation)
```
client/
  ├── screens/
  │   ├── Home.js
  │   ├── Login.js
  │   └── ...
  ├── navigation/
  │   ├── StackNavigator.js
  │   ├── bottomTabNavigator.js
  │   └── ...
  ├── components/
  │   └── ...
  ├── App.js
  └── ...
```

### After (Expo Router)
```
client/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── _layout.tsx
  │   ├── index.tsx
  │   ├── onboarding.tsx
  │   ├── (auth)/
  │   │   ├── _layout.tsx
  │   │   ├── login.tsx
  │   │   └── register.tsx
  │   ├── (tabs)/
  │   │   ├── _layout.tsx
  │   │   ├── index.tsx
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── ...
  ├── components/
  │   └── ...
  ├── context/
  │   └── ...
  ├── types/
  │   └── ...
  └── ...
```

## Key Technical Changes

1. **Navigation Changes**:
   - From `navigation.navigate('Screen')` to `router.push('/screen')`
   - From `route.params` to `useLocalSearchParams()`

2. **TypeScript Integration**:
   - Add type definitions for components, screens, and state
   - Use interfaces for consistent data structures
   - Create utility types for common patterns

3. **File Structure Changes**:
   - Move screens to the `app` directory
   - Use file paths to define routes
   - Use special files like `_layout.tsx` for shared layouts

## Monitoring and Evaluation

Throughout the migration, we will track:
- Number of screens and components migrated
- TypeScript coverage percentage
- Number of type errors resolved
- Performance metrics before and after migration
- Development velocity changes

## Conclusion

This migration represents a significant improvement to the project architecture, bringing modern TypeScript features and the benefits of file-based routing. While it requires an initial investment of time, the long-term benefits in maintainability, type safety, and developer experience will outweigh the migration costs.
