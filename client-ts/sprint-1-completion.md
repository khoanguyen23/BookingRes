# Sprint 1 Completion Report

## Task 1: Setup TypeScript Environment

### Completed Actions:

1. ✅ Created a new directory for the TypeScript migration project (`client-ts`)
2. ✅ Initialized a new Expo TypeScript project with the latest Expo SDK
3. ✅ Set up the basic Expo Router file structure
   - Created `app/_layout.tsx` for root layout
   - Created `app/index.tsx` for the home screen
4. ✅ Migrated the UserContext to TypeScript
   - Added proper type definitions for the user data
   - Implemented type-safe context provider
5. ✅ Created directory structure for component migration
   - Organized folders for components, hooks, utils, etc.
6. ✅ Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Configured `tsconfig.json` with proper settings
   - Added path aliases for simplified imports
7. ✅ Created documentation for the migration process
   - Added migration guide with TypeScript patterns
   - Documented file structure changes

### Verification Steps:

1. TypeScript Compilation: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript setup
2. Project Structure: Verify directory structure follows Expo Router conventions
3. Code Quality: Ensure code follows TypeScript best practices

### Next Steps (Sprint 2):

1. Start migrating core components from JavaScript to TypeScript
2. Set up tab navigation using Expo Router
3. Implement authentication flow with the migrated UserContext
4. Continue updating documentation with migration patterns

## Notes:

- The project is set up with proper TypeScript configuration
- The directory structure is organized for a clean migration
- The UserContext has been successfully migrated to TypeScript
- Basic app structure is in place for incremental migration
